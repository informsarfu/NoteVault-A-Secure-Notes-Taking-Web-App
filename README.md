# NoteVault - Notes-Taking Web Application using Flask

NoteVault is a Flask-based web application designed to simplify note-taking and organization. It allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their notes in a secure and intuitive manner.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and securely manage their notes. User passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.
- Note Creation: Users can easily create new notes, providing titles, content, and optional tags. Notes are timestamped for easy reference.
- Note Editing: Existing notes can be edited, allowing users to update the content, title, or tags.
- Note Deletion: Users can delete notes that are no longer needed.
- Note Organization: Notes can be tagged, making it easy to categorize and search for specific notes. Users can filter and sort notes based on tags or other criteria.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, used to handle routing, request handling, and other web-related tasks.
- Jinja: A powerful templating engine used for generating dynamic HTML templates. It allows for easy integration of Python code within HTML.
- SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for managing the application's backend database. It provides an abstraction layer over the database, making it easy to work with database records using Python objects.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Front-end technologies used for creating the user interface and design of the web application. HTML is used for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior.
